            New AmpliconMatrix name
        short-hint: |
            Default (leaving field blank) is same name, which would save over input object

    App Behavior
    </h2>

    <p>Note: in cases of joint probability ties between highest scoring genera, <i>assignment</i> of the genus is deterministic, with the first genus being chosen. 
    But in cases of <i>bootstrap</i> joint probability ties, ties are broken randomly. 
    This affects, across runs, where along the ranks cutoffs by confidence occur. 
    See RDP Classifier's Github page and publication for more details</p>
