    App Behavior
    </h2>

    <p>
    Note about interpreting the fixed-rank output format: 
    This should be taken with a grain of salt, knowing that taxonomy is not always fixed rank.
    Yes, the fixed ranks refer to the ranks of domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus.
    But sometimes taxonomy skips interim ranks or doesn't go all the way down to genus.
    In fact, the RDP Classifier convention to deal with training against taxonomic databases
    when some taxonomic annotations end prematurely is to create dummy genus nodes
    with the name bearing its parent (whatever rank that is) prepended to '_genera_incertae_sedis'.
    But how are missing interim nodes dealt with in the fixed-rank format?
    In this case, RDP Classifier will gap-fill the missing ranks with the name and bootstrap confidence
    of the next lowest available rank.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note about the filter-by-confidence output format:
    As you may have noticed, everything that is cut off by the bootstrap confidence threshold
    just gets the name of the last rank with a passable confidence, prepended with 'unclassified_'
    </p>


    <p>
    Note about randomness: the randomness of bootstrap confidence scores affects, across runs, 
    where along the ranks cutoffs by confidence may occur. 
    
    In cases of joint probability ties between highest scoring genera, 
    <i>assignment</i> of the genus is deterministic, with the first genus being chosen. 
    But in cases of <i>bootstrap</i> joint probability ties, ties are broken randomly,
    so that the bootstrap confidence is the inverse of the number of tying genera.
